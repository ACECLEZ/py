Question:
You are tasked with testing a Python program that simulates a bank account. The program consists of a loop that repeatedly asks the user for their desired action, which can be either "deposit" or "withdraw." Depending on the action, the user is prompted to enter an amount, and the program updates the bank account balance accordingly.

Your mission is to create test cases for this program.

For the "deposit" case:

Input: "deposit"
Input: 1000
Expected Output: "your balance now is $1000.0"
For the "withdraw" case with sufficient funds:

Input: "withdraw"
Input: 500
Expected Output: "withdraw success! your balance now is $500.0"
For the "withdraw" case with insufficient funds:

Input: "withdraw"
Input: 1500
Expected Output: "insufficient amount, you are short of $1000.0"
Please provide test cases for these scenarios and verify that the program behaves as expected.
